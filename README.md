# Use of MONAI library for medical image analysis
This repository contains how to use deep learning algorithms from MONAI libries to train models and conduct inference using Amazon SageMaker

  
# Overview
We demo the capability of using MONAI to transform, train the images and then annotate the medical images automatically. This repo was adapted from local model of 2 examples from [MONAI project](https://github.com/Project-MONAI), specifically on the [2D classification](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/2d_classification) from [MONAI tutorials](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials).
